# QR Scanner Mobile Testing Guide

## Changes Made

### 1. Installed QR Scanner Library
- Added `qr-scanner` package for real QR code detection
- Replaced the fake simulation with actual QR code scanning functionality

### 2. HTTPS Configuration
- Updated Vite config to support HTTPS (required for camera access on mobile)
- Added `dev:https` script for easy HTTPS development

### 3. Enhanced Mobile Support
- Improved error handling for camera permissions
- Added better mobile-specific error messages
- Enhanced UI for better mobile experience
- Added camera availability detection

## Testing on Mobile Device

### Prerequisites
- Ensure your mobile device and development machine are on the same WiFi network
- The app must be served over HTTPS for camera access to work on mobile devices

### Steps to Test:

1. **Start the development server with HTTPS:**
   ```bash
   cd moneysmart-mobile-main
   HTTPS=true npm run dev
   ```

2. **Find the Network URL:**
   - Look for the "Network:" URL in the terminal output (e.g., `https://192.168.1.5:8081/`)

3. **Access on Mobile:**
   - Open your mobile browser (Chrome/Safari)
   - Navigate to the Network URL
   - You'll see a security warning - click "Advanced" → "Proceed to [URL] (unsafe)"
   - This is normal for self-signed certificates in development

4. **Test the Scanner:**
   - Navigate to the Scanner page in the app
   - Tap "Open QR Scanner"
   - Allow camera permissions when prompted
   - Point your camera at any QR code to test

### Common Issues & Solutions:

#### Camera Not Working:
- **HTTPS Required**: Ensure you're using HTTPS (not HTTP)
- **Permissions**: Make sure camera permissions are granted
- **Secure Context**: Some browsers require HTTPS for camera access

#### Self-Signed Certificate Warning:
- This is normal in development
- Click "Advanced" and "Proceed" to continue
- In production, use a proper SSL certificate

#### Network Access:
- Make sure your mobile device is on the same WiFi network
- Check firewall settings if you can't access the Network URL

### Browser Compatibility:
- ✅ Chrome (Android/iOS)
- ✅ Safari (iOS)
- ✅ Firefox (Android)
- ✅ Edge (Android)

### QR Scanner Features:
- Real QR code detection (no more simulation)
- Automatic scanning when QR code is detected
- Support for various QR code formats
- Visual feedback with scan results
- Proper error handling and user guidance

## Production Deployment

For production deployment:
1. Ensure proper HTTPS/SSL certificates
2. Test camera permissions across different mobile browsers
3. Consider adding QR code generation for testing
4. Implement proper payment integration as needed

## Troubleshooting

### If Scanner Still Doesn't Work:

1. **Check Browser Console:**
   - Open browser dev tools on mobile
   - Look for camera-related errors

2. **Test Camera Access:**
   - Try accessing camera in other web apps
   - Ensure device camera is working

3. **Network Issues:**
   - Try accessing from the same device browser
   - Check if HTTPS is properly configured

4. **Clear Browser Cache:**
   - Clear cache and cookies
   - Try in incognito/private mode

The QR scanner now uses a real QR code scanning library and should work properly on mobile devices when served over HTTPS!
